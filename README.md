# hello-world
My first Github project

Hi world, Mohammad talk, a student who got lost in IT world, don't know what i want to take as career yet and i'm in my fourth year in college.

I think i'v started to like AI and ML, maybe because they are challenging, put a smile on your face, and nothing will bother you :).
